# What is it

Now the motivation is understood what is this crazy project.  

This is the repository that keeps the compilers, an AOT compiler and an JIT compiler, and the repository that also holds the specifications for the file format.  
Simply put the AOT compiler is thought as the compiler for distributing the final files. And the JIT is for developing the file.  

> This project is also a question, why we don't do this in the today web, since we edit using js, maybe it was simpler for developers to keep using the DOM tree that js is based on. But can't we use a turing complete language to use a system like this?  
> Or why we still have the DOM tree?
