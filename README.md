# noFussBinaryGraphicalFormat

This project is born from the [nfApplicationGraphics](https://github.com/ChrisArthLisboa/nfAppGraphics) project.
It's an idea as a multiplatform compiler for a unified binary representation for markup languages making faster rendering.  
The use of the file is meant to be simple and will be created 2 compilers, an Ahead Of Time(AOT) compiler and a Just In Time(JIT) compiler.
